Quick notes on the scripts in this directory:

computeEffectiveArea.C
validateCorrectedIsolation.C
     These scripts calibrate the effective area based on the mean of the
     isolation and then draw the efficiency as a function of Nvtx.
     No generator level weights are used.

computeEffectiveAreaV2.C
validateCorrectedIsolationV2.C
     These scripts calibrate the effective area based on the mean of the
     isolation and then draw the efficiency as a function of Nvtx.
     Generator level weights are used in these scripts.

validateCorrectedIsolationFlat.C
     Here we look at the central barrel region only and use different effective
     area constants.
     No generator weights.

computeIsolationCutoffs.C
     Computes the cutoff line in the iso(rho) space for a given
     XX% efficiency.

drawIsoWithCutoffs.C
     The script plots 2D uncorrected (pho + neu.had.) isolation vs rho
     and draws the XX% contours and the mean. The constants for contours 
     and the mean come from another script.

validateCorrectedIsolationAbs.C
     A variation of the validate script, draws the eff(Nvtx)
     not for relative but for the absolute total neutral isolation.

drawChIsoConvProgression.C
drawChIsoConvProgressionTest.C
     These scripts take charged isolation and convolute it with 
     a model pile-up isolation. The first works with the Poisson model
     and the second works with the Gaussian model.

drawChIsoConvolution.C
     This script draws plots demonstrating the convolution of the
     charged isolation with two models for a particular rho slice:
     a Poisson and a Gaussian.

drawIsolationROC.C
    Draws a single variable ROC: one for the default effective area
    correction and another for the alternative case (such as XX% cutoff-based).

drawSigBgIso.C
    Draw (neu.had. + pho. isolation) vs (rho) with and without the effective
    area correction, with and without a cut line superimposed.

computeEffectiveArea_v2.C
    A test of computing effective areas with via the mean, but
    after applying some upper cut-off to the values that go into the mean.
